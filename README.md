An awesome bot
===========

Rewrite of 7.1, nah not really of 7.1, just a new rewritten bot.

Easy to configure (for me at least),
and is able to restart seamless (without disconnecting to the IRC network),
even though it causes some "Hangup: 1" errors sometimes 
(which I have to figure out what I'm doing wrong, but it works :X).


Originally didn't make this to upload it to github, but why not update my old crap? Anyways, here's the (at the moment) latest source link which it has generated itself:
